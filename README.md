 Hotel Reservation


1. Introduction
This document provides a detailed solution for the Hotel Room Reservation System problem. The system is designed to efficiently allocate rooms to guests based on defined priority rules, minimizing travel time between booked rooms.
Problem Overview
A hotel has 97 rooms distributed across 10 floors.


Rooms are numbered sequentially (e.g., Floor 1: 101-110, Floor 2: 201-210).


Rooms on the 10th floor are numbered 1001-1007.


Travel times:


Horizontal travel: 1 minute between adjacent rooms.


Vertical travel: 2 minutes between floors.


Booking Rules:


A guest can book up to 5 rooms.


Priority is to book rooms on the same floor.


If not available on one floor, the system optimizes room selection to minimize total travel time.



2. System Design
Architecture
The system is designed using a clean, modular architecture with two primary components:


Frontend: Manages user interaction and room visualization.


Backend: Handles the core logic of room selection, travel time calculation, and booking rules.


Room Selection Logic
Rooms are first checked for availability on the same floor.


If the required rooms are not available on one floor, the system calculates the combined travel time (horizontal + vertical) for optimal room selection.


3. Functionalities
User Interface
Input: Accepts the number of rooms to book.


Book Button: Triggers the room allocation process.


Visualization: Displays the current room occupancy status in a grid format.


Random Occupancy: Simulates random room occupancy.


Reset Button: Clears all bookings and resets the system.





4. Algorithm and Logic
Room Allocation Algorithm
Calculate available rooms on each floor.


Prioritize rooms on the same floor for booking.


If insufficient, calculate the travel time for cross-floor booking combinations.


Choose the combination with the lowest total travel time.


Travel Time Calculation
Horizontal Travel: Calculated as the difference between adjacent room numbers on the same floor.


Vertical Travel: Calculated as the difference in floor levels multiplied by 2 (2 minutes per floor).


Example Scenarios
If a guest wants 4 rooms and all are available on one floor, they are booked directly.


If not, the system considers combinations across floors, calculating travel time to select the most efficient arrangement.


5. Technical Details
The solution uses a TypeScript-based implementation for type safety and clarity.


The system is optimized for fast calculations of travel time using efficient data structures (arrays for room tracking).


A priority queue approach is used to always select the optimal room combination.


6. Code Logic (Simplified)
Room data is stored in a 2D array representing each floor.


The algorithm iterates over each floor, checking availability and calculating travel time.


Optimal room combinations are determined using a priority queue, ensuring the lowest travel time is selected.


Functions are modular, with clear separation of concerns (e.g., room selection, travel time calculation, visualization).


7. Test Cases and Examples
Test Case 1: Booking 3 rooms on an empty floor (direct booking).


Test Case 2: Booking 5 rooms with partial availability on one floor (multi-floor booking).


Test Case 3: Booking 4 rooms with scattered availability (calculates optimal combination).


8. Conclusion
This solution provides an efficient, optimized approach to room booking while minimizing travel time.


Future improvements could include dynamic room pricing, user authentication, and enhanced UI.
